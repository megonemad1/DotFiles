= Ssh Config Files
DotFiles has reserved this directory for the ssh_config files for ssh connections.
'ssh_config' files are aliased to the file name to aid with smooth connections. 

== Example Config
the following is an example of an ssh config file. the standard ssh_config can use wild cards in the host it is however advisable to avoid that here. the host is also used as the ssh address and so isn't populated with a wildcard

    Host dev
        HostName dev.example.com
        User john
        Port 2322
